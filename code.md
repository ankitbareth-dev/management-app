I want to upgrade my React + Vanilla JS project to React with TypeScript. Currently, the project has a lot of duplicated logic and CSS, minimal error handling, and isn't well-optimized or scalable. My goal is to refactor it for better structure, maintainability, and reliability in production.

The app includes a store that uses Context API with useReducer—I’d prefer to stick with this and not introduce any new state management libraries. I also have several components and service files already in use.

How should I approach this migration and restructuring process step by step? And what’s the best way to share my code with you for guidance?
